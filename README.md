# Purpose
Accessiblity standards must be met to ensure good business practices which allow a website to be accessible to people with disabilities and those requiring assistive technologies, while helping businesses avoid unnecessary litigation. Increased accessibility also optimizes a page's ranking in search engines such as Google. Additional motivation for refactoring the Horiseon website is to format the code following sequential and logical semantic HTML practices, which improves the flow and specificity of content sections, and promotes long-term sustainability. We achieve this by ensuring functioning links, such as making the Search Engine Optimization tab direct to the appropriate section below on the webpage, replacing div tags with semantic HTML elements, rearranging and consolidating CSS style properties, using alt attributes on images, and providing a concise and descriptive title to the website. In the future, Horiseon may want to look into making their site more mobile-responsive.

# Usage
1. Open the Horiseon URL in your browser.
2. Navigate the website by scrolling up and down and using the top navigation bar to shortcut to specific sections.
